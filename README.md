# Twitter Sentiment Analysis through the Fine-Tuning of TwHIN-BERT


During the past several years, Twitter has become a critical communication medium of celebrities, influencers, and major industry and political leaders such as Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and many others. The platform provoked various debates at the end of October 2022, when it was acquired by one of the richest known persons in the world, Elon Musk. Because tweets usually contain mostly textual content, analyzing this social media should be attempted using techniques from natural language processing. We propose a system that performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data (tweets) and infers public opinion (of Twitter users) on certain topics of interest, such as international developments and controversies. Our model implements the pre-trained TwHIN-BERT language model based on BERT (Zhang et al., 2022), fine-tuned on the Sentiment140 dataset for the purposes of predicting sentiment as either positive or negative. We collect new tweets using snscrape, an open-source python library, and perform sentiment analysis on the scraped data to estimate  Twitter usersâ€™ aggregated sentiment of any topic at any point in time. After just two epochs performed on 500 thousand tweets, the model achieves an F1-score of 0.845 on balanced, human-labeled test data.
